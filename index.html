					<p style="font-size: large;">
						I am currently engaged in developing custom software solutions tailored specifically for
						universities, with a focus on enhancing academic and administrative processes. In addition to
						this core role, I am actively contributing to the establishment and management of a Central of
						Excellence (CoE) within the university's IT framework. This CoE serves as a centralized hub for
						expertise, best practices, and innovative technologies related to software development and IT
						solutions.

						<br><br>In my capacity, I am responsible for designing and developing software applications that
						streamline various university operations such as student enrollment, course management, grading
						systems, and administrative workflows. These custom software solutions are designed to meet the
						unique needs and challenges faced by educational institutions, ensuring efficiency, accuracy,
						and data security.

						<br><br>Moreover, my involvement in the CoE extends beyond software development. I actively
						participate in knowledge sharing sessions, workshops, and training programs aimed at upskilling
						IT teams and fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. By staying abreast of
						emerging technologies, industry trends, and best practices, I contribute to driving digital
						transformation initiatives across the university ecosystem.

						<br><br>Overall, my role encompasses not only hands-on software development but also strategic
						planning, collaboration with stakeholders, and building capabilities within the organization
						through the CoE framework. This holistic approach ensures that our custom software solutions
						align seamlessly with the university's objectives, enhancing productivity, data management, and
						overall operational efficiency.
